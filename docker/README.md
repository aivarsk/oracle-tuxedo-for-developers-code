# Docker image

Since images can't be provided due to Tuxedo licencing restrictions, here is a 
`Dockerfile` used to build the image for training. Customizations required:

- `.vimrc` is empty, bring your own config
- `.tmux.conf` is empty, bring your own config
- `http://localhost/tuxedo122200_64_Linux_01_x86.zip` must be changed to a location serving
  the Tuxedo installation.
